1) Mallory is already printing the contents by default.

python3 Bob.py 8047 none
python3 Mallory.py 127.0.0.1 8080 8047 none
python3 Alice.py 127.0.0.1 8080 none

-> Alice sends a message


2)Mallory is already printing the contents by default

python3 Bob.py 8047 mac
python3 Mallory.py 127.0.0.1 8080 8047 mac
python3 Alice.py 127.0.0.1 8080 mac

3)(Mallory.py) Between lines 58-65 set msg to be the modified message. Example: uncomment the line 61 or 62

python3 Bob.py 8047 none
python3 Mallory.py 127.0.0.1 8080 8047 none
python3 Alice.py 127.0.0.1 8080 none

4)Have Mallory truncate the cipher text in a way that produces a truncated plain text; Example: uncomment lines 91-92. If the plain text is sufficiently long,
    this will truncate the message and not be detectable in this configuration.

python3 Bob.py 8047 symmetric
python3 Mallory.py 127.0.0.1 8080 8047 symmetric
python3 Alice.py 127.0.0.1 8080 symmetric

5) You cannot since we have count in place, and Bob is checking the count that he is receiving with his local count.
If the counts don't line up; Bob quits and ends the connection. If Mallory were to change the count parsed from Alice the mac
would be wrong and Bob will detect it; therefore quit and close the connection
